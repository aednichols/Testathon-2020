# [OpenWDL Testathon, Feb 18-19, 2020](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360039208432-Announcing-the-OpenWDL-Testathon-Feb-18-19-2020)

This repo includes a [pytest-wdl](https://github.com/EliLillyCo/pytest-wdl) 
skeleton and a  [pytest-workflow](https://github.com/LUMC/pytest-workflow) 
skeleton for developing test cases for the WDL language specification. While 
these are suggested as a "shovel-ready" starting point for participants, other 
testing frameworks and approaches are equally welcomed, as one of the 
Testathon's goals is to develop general best practices for WDL testing.

## Getting started

Each test framework has its own README highlighting how to run and create 
tests.
